# Possum Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Possum Dataset, which provides information on 100 possums. The dataset includes morphological measurements such as head length, body length, tail length, and limb length.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to explore the dataset, analyze the variables, and identify correlations between them. Various statistical techniques, including boxplots and regression modeling, will be employed to understand the relationships between the variables and the age of possums.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis and visualize the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to start the Streamlit application:
    ```
    streamlit run possum.py
    ```
5. Access the Streamlit application in your web browser by visiting the provided URL.

## Repository Structure

- `possum.py`: Contains the Streamlit application code for data analysis and visualization.
- `data/`: Contains the Possum Dataset in CSV format.
- `images/`: Contains relevant images used in the README and notebooks.
- `saved_models/`: Contains our 2 Random Forests (one for the prediction and the other one for the prediction interval).

## Results and Conclusions

The findings and conclusions derived from this analysis will be presented within the Streamlit application. The insights gained from this project can contribute to a better understanding of possum development and have implications for conservation efforts and ecological studies.
